## Agent

Agent defines a configured agent in the city.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique identifier for this agent. |
| `dir` | string |  |  | Dir is the working directory for the agent session. |
| `scope` | string |  |  | Scope defines where this agent is instantiated: "city" (one per city) or "rig" (one per rig, the default). Only meaningful for pack-defined agents; inline agents in city.toml use Dir directly. When set, replaces the older city_agents list mechanism. Enum: `city`, `rig` |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended prevents the reconciler from spawning this agent. Toggle with gc agent suspend/resume. |
| `pre_start` | []string |  |  | PreStart is a list of shell commands run before session creation. Commands run on the target filesystem: locally for tmux, inside the pod/container for exec providers. Template variables same as session_setup. |
| `prompt_template` | string |  |  | PromptTemplate is the path to this agent's prompt template file. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. |
| `nudge` | string |  |  | Nudge is text typed into the agent's tmux session after startup. Used for CLI agents that don't accept command-line prompts. |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider names the provider preset to use for this agent. |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for this agent. |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider's default arguments. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  | `arg` | PromptMode controls how prompts are delivered: "arg", "flag", or "none". Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag is the CLI flag used to pass prompts when prompt_mode is "flag". |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs is milliseconds to wait after launch before considering the agent ready. |
| `ready_prompt_prefix` | string |  |  | ReadyPromptPrefix is the string prefix that indicates the agent is ready for input. |
| `process_names` | []string |  |  | ProcessNames lists process names to look for when checking if the agent is running. |
| `emits_permission_warning` | boolean |  |  | EmitsPermissionWarning indicates whether the agent emits permission prompts that should be suppressed. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env sets additional environment variables for the agent process. |
| `pool` | PoolConfig |  |  | Pool configures elastic pool behavior. When set, the agent becomes a pool. |
| `work_query` | string |  |  | WorkQuery is the shell command to find available work for this agent. Used by gc hook and available in prompt templates as {{.WorkQuery}}. Default for fixed agents: "bd ready --assignee=<qualified-name>". Default for pool agents: "bd ready --label=pool:<qualified-name> --limit=1". Override to integrate with external task systems. |
| `sling_query` | string |  |  | SlingQuery is the command template to route a bead to this agent/pool. Used by gc sling to make a bead visible to the target's work_query. The placeholder {} is replaced with the bead ID at runtime. Default for fixed agents: "bd update {} --assignee=<qualified-name>". Default for pool agents: "bd update {} --add-label=pool:<qualified-name>". Pool agents must set both sling_query and work_query, or neither. |
| `idle_timeout` | string |  |  | IdleTimeout is the maximum time an agent session can be inactive before the controller kills and restarts it. Duration string (e.g., "15m", "1h"). Empty (default) disables idle checking. |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks overrides workspace-level install_agent_hooks for this agent. When set, replaces (not adds to) the workspace default. |
| `hooks_installed` | boolean |  |  | HooksInstalled overrides automatic hook detection. Set to true when hooks are manually installed (e.g., merged into the project's own hook config) and auto-installation via install_agent_hooks is not desired. When true, the agent is treated as hook-enabled for startup behavior: no prime instruction in beacon and no delayed nudge. Interacts with install_agent_hooks — set this instead when hooks are pre-installed. |
| `session_setup` | []string |  |  | SessionSetup is a list of shell commands run after session creation. Each command is a template string supporting placeholders: {{.Session}}, {{.Agent}}, {{.Rig}}, {{.CityRoot}}, {{.CityName}}, {{.WorkDir}}. Commands run in gc's process (not inside the agent session) via sh -c. |
| `session_setup_script` | string |  |  | SessionSetupScript is the path to a script run after session_setup commands. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. The script receives context via environment variables (GC_SESSION plus existing GC_* vars). |
| `session_live` | []string |  |  | SessionLive is a list of shell commands that are safe to re-apply without restarting the agent. Run at startup (after session_setup) and re-applied on config change without triggering a restart. Must be idempotent. Typical use: tmux theming, keybindings, status bars. Same template placeholders as session_setup. |
| `overlay_dir` | string |  |  | OverlayDir is a directory whose contents are recursively copied (additive) into the agent's working directory at startup. Existing files are not overwritten. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). |
| `default_sling_formula` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingFormula is the formula name automatically applied via --on when beads are slung to this agent, unless --no-formula is set. Example: "mol-polecat-work" |
| `inject_fragments` | []string |  |  | InjectFragments lists named template fragments to append to this agent's rendered prompt. Fragments come from shared template directories across all loaded packs. Each name must match a {{ define "name" }} block. |
| `fallback` | boolean |  |  | Fallback marks this agent as a fallback definition. During pack composition, a non-fallback agent with the same name wins silently. When two fallbacks collide, the first loaded (depth-first) wins. |

| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for all agents. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended controls whether the city is suspended. When true, all agents are effectively suspended: the reconciler won't spawn them, and gc hook/prime return empty. Inherits downward — individual agent/rig suspended fields are checked independently. |
| `session_template` | string |  |  | SessionTemplate is a template string supporting placeholders: {{.City}}, {{.Agent}} (sanitized), {{.Dir}}, {{.Name}}. Controls tmux session naming. Default (empty): "{{.Agent}}" — just the sanitized agent name. Per-city tmux socket isolation makes a city prefix unnecessary. |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks lists provider names whose hooks should be installed into agent working directories. Agent-level overrides workspace-level (replace, not additive). Supported: "claude", "gemini", "opencode", "copilot". |
| `pack` | string |  |  | Pack is the path to a city-level pack directory. Stamps agents with dir="" (city-scoped). Resolved like rig packs. Combined with rig-level packs — city pack agents get dir="" while rig pack agents inherit the rig name as their dir. |
| `packs` | []string |  |  | CityPacks lists multiple city-level pack directories. Each is loaded and expanded like Pack. When both Pack and CityPacks are set, Pack is prepended to the list. Agents from the first pack come first (deterministic ordering). |
| `global_fragments` | []string |  |  | GlobalFragments lists named template fragments injected into every agent's rendered prompt. Applied before per-agent InjectFragments. Each name must match a {{ define "name" }} block from a pack's prompts/shared/ directory. |
| `includes` | []string |  |  | Includes lists pack directories or URLs to compose into this workspace. Replaces the older pack/packs fields. Each entry is a local path, a git source//sub#ref URL, or a GitHub tree URL. |
