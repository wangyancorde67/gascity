## Agent

Agent defines a configured agent in the city.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique identifier for this agent. |
| `description` | string |  |  | Description is a human-readable description shown in MC's session creation UI. |
| `dir` | string |  |  | Dir is the working directory for the agent session. |
| `scope` | string |  |  | Scope defines where this agent is instantiated: "city" (one per city) or "rig" (one per rig, the default). Only meaningful for pack-defined agents; inline agents in city.toml use Dir directly. When set, replaces the older city_agents list mechanism. Enum: `city`, `rig` |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended prevents the reconciler from spawning this agent. Toggle with gc agent suspend/resume. |
| `pre_start` | []string |  |  | PreStart is a list of shell commands run before session creation. Commands run on the target filesystem: locally for tmux, inside the pod/container for exec providers. Template variables same as session_setup. |
| `prompt_template` | string |  |  | PromptTemplate is the path to this agent's prompt template file. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. |
| `nudge` | string |  |  | Nudge is text typed into the agent's tmux session after startup. Used for CLI agents that don't accept command-line prompts. |
| `session` | string |  |  | Session overrides the session transport for this agent. "" (default) uses the city-level session provider (typically tmux). "acp" uses the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio). The agent's resolved provider must have supports_acp = true. Enum: `acp` |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider names the provider preset to use for this agent. |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for this agent. |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider's default arguments. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  | `arg` | PromptMode controls how prompts are delivered: "arg", "flag", or "none". Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag is the CLI flag used to pass prompts when prompt_mode is "flag". |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs is milliseconds to wait after launch before considering the agent ready. |

| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env sets additional environment variables for the agent process. |
| `pool` | PoolConfig |  |  | Pool configures elastic pool behavior. When set, the agent becomes a pool. |
| `work_query` | string |  |  | WorkQuery is the shell command to find available work for this agent. Used by gc hook and available in prompt templates as {{.WorkQuery}}. Also used by the controller's reconciler to detect pending work (WakeWork reason): non-empty output means work exists, which wakes sleeping sessions even without WakeConfig. Default for fixed agents: "bd ready --assignee=<qualified-name>". Default for pool agents: "bd ready --label=pool:<qualified-name> --limit=1". Override to integrate with external task systems. |
| `sling_query` | string |  |  | SlingQuery is the command template to route a bead to this agent/pool. Used by gc sling to make a bead visible to the target's work_query. The placeholder {} is replaced with the bead ID at runtime. Default for fixed agents: "bd update {} --assignee=<qualified-name>". Default for pool agents: "bd update {} --add-label=pool:<qualified-name>". Pool agents must set both sling_query and work_query, or neither. |
| `idle_timeout` | string |  |  | IdleTimeout is the maximum time an agent session can be inactive before the controller kills and restarts it. Duration string (e.g., "15m", "1h"). Empty (default) disables idle checking. |

| `hooks_installed` | boolean |  |  | HooksInstalled overrides automatic hook detection. Set to true when hooks are manually installed (e.g., merged into the project's own hook config) and auto-installation via install_agent_hooks is not desired. When true, the agent is treated as hook-enabled for startup behavior: no prime instruction in beacon and no delayed nudge. Interacts with install_agent_hooks — set this instead when hooks are pre-installed. |
| `session_setup` | []string |  |  | SessionSetup is a list of shell commands run after session creation. Each command is a template string supporting placeholders: {{.Session}}, {{.Agent}}, {{.Rig}}, {{.CityRoot}}, {{.CityName}}, {{.WorkDir}}. Commands run in gc's process (not inside the agent session) via sh -c. |
| `session_setup_script` | string |  |  | SessionSetupScript is the path to a script run after session_setup commands. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. The script receives context via environment variables (GC_SESSION plus existing GC_* vars). |
| `session_live` | []string |  |  | SessionLive is a list of shell commands that are safe to re-apply without restarting the agent. Run at startup (after session_setup) and re-applied on config change without triggering a restart. Must be idempotent. Typical use: tmux theming, keybindings, status bars. Same template placeholders as session_setup. |
| `overlay_dir` | string |  |  | OverlayDir is a directory whose contents are recursively copied (additive) into the agent's working directory at startup. Existing files are not overwritten. Relative paths resolve against the declaring config file's directory (pack-safe). |
| `default_sling_formula` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingFormula is the formula name automatically applied via --on when beads are slung to this agent, unless --no-formula is set. Example: "mol-polecat-work" |
| `inject_fragments` | []string |  |  | InjectFragments lists named template fragments to append to this agent's rendered prompt. Fragments come from shared template directories across all loaded packs. Each name must match a {{ define "name" }} block. |
| `attach` | boolean |  |  | Attach controls whether the agent's session supports interactive attachment (e.g., tmux attach). When false, the agent can use a lighter runtime (subprocess instead of tmux). Defaults to true. |
| `fallback` | boolean |  |  | Fallback marks this agent as a fallback definition. During pack composition, a non-fallback agent with the same name wins silently. When two fallbacks collide, the first loaded (depth-first) wins. |
| `depends_on` | []string |  |  | DependsOn lists agent names that must be awake before this agent wakes. Used for dependency-ordered startup and shutdown. Validated for cycles at config load time. |
| `wake_mode` | string |  |  | WakeMode controls context freshness across sleep/wake cycles. "resume" (default): reuse provider session key for conversation continuity. "fresh": start a new provider session on every wake (polecat pattern). Enum: `resume`, `fresh` |

| `args` | []string |  |  | Args overrides the provider args. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  |  | PromptMode overrides prompt delivery mode. Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag overrides the prompt flag. |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs overrides the ready delay in milliseconds. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env adds or overrides environment variables. |
| `env_remove` | []string |  |  | EnvRemove lists env var keys to remove. |
| `_replace` | boolean |  |  | Replace replaces the entire provider block instead of deep-merging. |

## ProviderSpec

ProviderSpec defines a named provider's startup parameters.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `display_name` | string |  |  | DisplayName is the human-readable name shown in UI and logs. |
| `command` | string |  |  | Command is the executable to run for this provider. |
| `args` | []string |  |  | Args are default command-line arguments passed to the provider. |
| `prompt_mode` | string |  | `arg` | PromptMode controls how prompts are delivered: "arg", "flag", or "none". Enum: `arg`, `flag`, `none` |
| `prompt_flag` | string |  |  | PromptFlag is the CLI flag used when prompt_mode is "flag" (e.g. "--prompt"). |
| `ready_delay_ms` | integer |  |  | ReadyDelayMs is milliseconds to wait after launch before the provider is considered ready. |
| `ready_prompt_prefix` | string |  |  | ReadyPromptPrefix is the string prefix that indicates the provider is ready for input. |
| `process_names` | []string |  |  | ProcessNames lists process names to look for when checking if the provider is running. |
| `emits_permission_warning` | boolean |  |  | EmitsPermissionWarning indicates whether the provider emits permission prompts. |
| `env` | map[string]string |  |  | Env sets additional environment variables for the provider process. |
| `path_check` | string |  |  | PathCheck overrides the binary name used for PATH detection. When set, lookupProvider and detectProviderName use this instead of Command for exec.LookPath checks. Useful when Command is a shell wrapper (e.g. sh -c '...') but we need to verify the real binary is installed. |
| `supports_acp` | boolean |  |  | SupportsACP indicates the binary speaks the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio). When an agent sets session = "acp", its resolved provider must have SupportsACP = true. |
| `supports_hooks` | boolean |  |  | SupportsHooks indicates the provider has an executable hook mechanism (settings.json, plugins, etc.) for lifecycle events. |
| `instructions_file` | string |  |  | InstructionsFile is the filename the provider reads for project instructions (e.g., "CLAUDE.md", "AGENTS.md"). Empty defaults to "AGENTS.md". |
| `resume_flag` | string |  |  | ResumeFlag is the CLI flag for resuming a session by ID. Empty means the provider does not support resume. Examples: "--resume" (claude), "resume" (codex) |
| `resume_style` | string |  |  | ResumeStyle controls how ResumeFlag is applied:   "flag"       → command --resume <key>              (default)   "subcommand" → command resume <key> |
| `session_id_flag` | string |  |  | SessionIDFlag is the CLI flag for creating a session with a specific ID. Enables the Generate & Pass strategy for session key management. Example: "--session-id" (claude) |
| `permission_modes` | map[string]string |  |  | PermissionModes maps permission mode names to CLI flags. Example: {"unrestricted": "--dangerously-skip-permissions", "plan": "--permission-mode plan"} This is a config-only lookup table consumed by external clients (e.g., Mission Control) to populate permission mode dropdowns. Launch-time flag substitution is planned for a follow-up PR — currently no runtime code reads this field. |
| `options_schema` | []ProviderOption |  |  | OptionsSchema declares the configurable options this provider supports. Each option maps to CLI args via its Choices[].FlagArgs field. Serialized via a dedicated DTO (not directly to JSON) so FlagArgs stays server-side. |

## Rig

Rig defines an external project registered in the city.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the unique identifier for this rig. |
| `path` | string | **yes** |  | Path is the absolute filesystem path to the rig's repository. |
| `prefix` | string |  |  | Prefix overrides the auto-derived bead ID prefix for this rig. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended prevents the reconciler from spawning agents in this rig. Toggle with gc rig suspend/resume. |
| `formulas_dir` | string |  |  | FormulasDir is a rig-local formula directory (Layer 4). Overrides pack formulas for this rig by filename. Relative paths resolve against the city directory. |
| `includes` | []string |  |  | Includes lists pack directories or URLs for this rig. Replaces the older pack/packs fields. Each entry is a local path, a git source//sub#ref URL, or a GitHub tree URL. |
| `overrides` | []AgentOverride |  |  | Overrides are per-agent patches applied after pack expansion. |
| `default_sling_target` | string |  |  | DefaultSlingTarget is the agent qualified name used when gc sling is invoked with only a bead ID (no explicit target). Resolved via resolveAgentIdentity. Example: "rig/polecat" |

## RigPatch

RigPatch modifies an existing rig identified by Name.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the targeting key (required). Must match an existing rig's name. |
| `path` | string |  |  | Path overrides the rig's filesystem path. |
| `prefix` | string |  |  | Prefix overrides the bead ID prefix. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended overrides the rig's suspended state. |

## SessionConfig

SessionConfig holds session provider settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider selects the session backend: "fake", "fail", "subprocess", "acp", "exec:<script>", "k8s", or "" (default: tmux). |
| `k8s` | K8sConfig |  |  | K8s holds Kubernetes-specific settings for the native K8s provider. |
| `acp` | ACPSessionConfig |  |  | ACP holds settings for the ACP (Agent Client Protocol) session provider. |
| `setup_timeout` | string |  | `10s` | SetupTimeout is the per-command/script timeout for session setup and pre_start commands. Duration string (e.g., "10s", "30s"). Defaults to "10s". |
| `nudge_ready_timeout` | string |  | `10s` | NudgeReadyTimeout is how long to wait for the agent to be ready before sending nudge text. Duration string. Defaults to "10s". |
| `nudge_retry_interval` | string |  | `500ms` | NudgeRetryInterval is the retry interval between nudge readiness polls. Duration string. Defaults to "500ms". |
| `nudge_lock_timeout` | string |  | `30s` | NudgeLockTimeout is how long to wait to acquire the per-session nudge lock. Duration string. Defaults to "30s". |
| `debounce_ms` | integer |  | `500` | DebounceMs is the default debounce interval in milliseconds for send-keys. Defaults to 500. |
| `display_ms` | integer |  | `5000` | DisplayMs is the default display duration in milliseconds for status messages. Defaults to 5000. |
| `startup_timeout` | string |  | `60s` | StartupTimeout is how long to wait for each agent's Start() call before treating it as failed. Duration string (e.g., "60s", "2m"). Defaults to "60s". |
| `socket` | string |  |  | Socket specifies the tmux socket name for per-city isolation. When set, all tmux commands use "tmux -L <socket>" to connect to a dedicated server. When empty, defaults to the city name (workspace.name) — giving every city its own tmux server automatically. Set explicitly to override. |
| `remote_match` | string |  |  | RemoteMatch is a substring pattern for the hybrid provider to route sessions to the remote (K8s) backend. Sessions whose names contain this pattern go to K8s; all others stay local (tmux). Overridden by the GC_HYBRID_REMOTE_MATCH env var if set. |

## Workspace

Workspace holds city-level metadata and optional defaults that apply to all agents unless overridden per-agent.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **yes** |  | Name is the human-readable name for this city. |
| `provider` | string |  |  | Provider is the default provider name used by agents that don't specify one. |
| `start_command` | string |  |  | StartCommand overrides the provider's command for all agents. |
| `suspended` | boolean |  |  | Suspended controls whether the city is suspended. When true, all agents are effectively suspended: the reconciler won't spawn them, and gc hook/prime return empty. Inherits downward — individual agent/rig suspended fields are checked independently. |
| `session_template` | string |  |  | SessionTemplate is a template string supporting placeholders: {{.City}}, {{.Agent}} (sanitized), {{.Dir}}, {{.Name}}. Controls tmux session naming. Default (empty): "{{.Agent}}" — just the sanitized agent name. Per-city tmux socket isolation makes a city prefix unnecessary. |
| `install_agent_hooks` | []string |  |  | InstallAgentHooks lists provider names whose hooks should be installed into agent working directories. Agent-level overrides workspace-level (replace, not additive). Supported: "claude", "gemini", "opencode", "copilot". |
| `global_fragments` | []string |  |  | GlobalFragments lists named template fragments injected into every agent's rendered prompt. Applied before per-agent InjectFragments. Each name must match a {{ define "name" }} block from a pack's prompts/shared/ directory. |
| `includes` | []string |  |  | Includes lists pack directories or URLs to compose into this workspace. Replaces the older pack/packs fields. Each entry is a local path, a git source//sub#ref URL, or a GitHub tree URL. |
