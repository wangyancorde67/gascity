| Scope | New pack/registry command surface and discovery model |

This proposal was originally drafted in a separate exploratory repository and
is mirrored here so the design can be reviewed in the same repo that would
eventually implement it.

This document builds on the **PackV2** work from the 0.15.0 release and makes
no change to package format or loader semantics.

It does however do two things:
1. Introduce the notion of a *registry* where Gas City packs can be published
   and discovered.
2. Propose a coherent CLI interface across all package operations (discovery,
   import, upgrade, et al.)

The proposed `gc pack` CLI rationalizes the import-facing surface introduced as
`gc import` in 0.15.0. The primary difference is more precise targeting of
which entity's imports are being impacted (in-scope pack vs. city pack vs.
targeted rig). A secondary difference is that `add` accepts the result of a
registry lookup, so you can add an import without having to paste a full URL or
path.

This proposal would also subsume the two legacy `gc pack` commands, `fetch` and
`list`, to land on a single coherent surface area.

All of this said, the main new concept in this proposal is a registry, so let's
begin there.

## Registries

A Gas City registry is simply a `registry.toml` file that is typically fetched
over HTTP.

A `registry.toml` file is a list of packages with a name, version info,
description, and the URL of the source. Registries do not store packs; they are
an index of packs. Once the source URL is read from `registry.toml`, the
registry is out of the loop.

The registry entry for a pack lists one or more versioned releases of the pack.
Here is an example `registry.toml` file.

```toml
schema = 1

[[pack]]
name = "lighthouse"
description = "Harbor-watch checks and incident response workflows."
source = "https://packages.example/main/lighthouse"

  [[pack.release]]
  version = "1.2.0"
  commit = "abc123"
  hash = "sha256:..."
  description = "Adds dock patrol checks and improves incident triage."

[[pack]]
name = "weatherglass"
description = "Forecasting and telemetry helpers for harbor operations."
source = "https://packages.example/main/weatherglass"

  [[pack.release]]
  version = "0.4.0"
  commit = "def456"
  hash = "sha256:..."
  description = "First public release."
```

A registry can advertise multiple versions of the same pack, with distinct
notes on each version:

```toml
[[pack]]
name = "lighthouse"
description = "Harbor-watch checks and incident response workflows."
source = "https://packages.example/main/lighthouse"

  [[pack.release]]
  version = "1.2.0"
  commit = "abc123"
  hash = "sha256:..."
  description = "Adds dock patrol checks and improves incident triage."

  [[pack.release]]
  version = "1.1.0"
  commit = "def456"
  hash = "sha256:..."
  description = "Stabilizes patrol behavior and wakeup handling."
```

To facilitate discovery, a Gas City installation maintains a list of registries
that are consulted when searching for or enumerating available packs. That list
is a system-managed file, `~/.gc/registries.toml`, and has the standard `add` /
`list` / `remove` CLI operations. A fresh Gas City installation would normally
include a `main` entry pointing at the Gas City-managed registry. The examples
below use plain catalog URLs rather than repository URLs so the fetch semantics
stay clear. A fuller example with two configured registries looks like this:

```toml
schema = 1

[[registry]]
name = "main"
source = "https://registries.gascity.example/main/registry.toml"

[[registry]]
name = "acme"
source = "https://registries.acme.example/catalog/registry.toml"
```

The `registries.toml` file can point to multiple registries. Each configured
registry name must be unique locally; those local names are what disambiguate
packs when two or more registries publish the same pack name.

For this proposal, a registry `source` is a locator for the registry catalog,
not a git-specific concept. A source may be:

- a direct HTTP(S) URL to `registry.toml`
- an HTTP(S) base URL where `registry.toml` is implied
- a local filesystem path to `registry.toml`
- a local directory containing `registry.toml`

This proposal does not otherwise tie registries to GitHub or git semantics.

## CLI Command Trees

The operations one wants to do when managing imports from one package to
another have *some* overlap with the operations one wants to do on a registry;
however, there are enough differences to warrant two command trees:

- `gc pack` which is focused exclusively on managing package-to-package import
  graphs
- `gc registry` which is focused on discovery of packages based on name,
  description, or version

The two work in tandem: the result of a registry search is a qualified name
that can be passed directly to the add command that creates the import.

This design is silent with respect to *where* packages are stored:

- Registries are index only
- Caches are largely opaque and contain fetched content only based on a pack's
  `[import]` declarations.
- `gc pack show` inspects local imports; `gc registry show` inspects exact
  catalog entries

### `gc registry`

```text
gc registry list
gc registry add <registry-name> <source>
gc registry remove <registry-name>
gc registry search [query] [--registry <name>]
gc registry show <qualified-pack-name>
```

### `gc pack`

```text
gc pack add <source-or-name> [--name <import-name>] [--version <constraint>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack remove <import-name> [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack list [--transitive] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack show <import-name> [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack fetch [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack outdated [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
gc pack upgrade [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

## `gc pack`

`gc pack` owns imports, fetched state, and upgrade flow for the selected pack.

### Scope model

The baseline target is the ambient pack, when one can be discovered from the
working directory.

Working rules:

- if the current directory is inside a pack definition, the ambient pack is
  that surrounding pack
- if the current directory is inside a rigged directory but not inside a
  different pack definition, the ambient pack is the pack that defines the
  owning city
- if the current directory is in neither a pack directory nor a rigged
  directory, there is no ambient pack and the user must pass `--pack` or
  `--rig`

The two scope-shaping flags on most `gc pack` commands are:

- `--pack <path>` explicitly targets the pack the import will be added to
- `--rig <name-or-path>` opts into rig-scoped import behavior within the city
  associated with the ambient or explicitly targeted pack
- rig-scoped imports only happen when `--rig` is explicitly passed
- `--rig` never creates an ambient rig scope on its own; it is always an
  explicit refinement

When both `--pack` and `--rig` are passed, `--rig` is resolved relative to the
city associated with `--pack`.

### Verb set

| Verb | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `add` | Add an import to the selected scope and fetch it by default. |
| `remove` | Remove an import from the selected scope. |
| `list` | List imports in the selected scope. |
| `show` | Show one imported pack in the selected scope. |
| `fetch` | Fetch resolved pack content into cache for the selected scope. |
| `outdated` | Show which imported packs could be upgraded. |
| `upgrade` | Upgrade imported packs in scope and fetch the new resolved result. |

### Signatures and semantics

#### `gc pack add`

```text
gc pack add <source-or-name> [--name <import-name>] [--version <constraint>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- adds an import to the selected scope
- fetches the resolved content into cache by default
- accepts:
  - qualified registry names like `main:lighthouse`
  - unqualified registry names when resolution is unambiguous
  - direct source URLs
  - local paths
- input is interpreted in this order:
  - contains `:` and is not a URL scheme: qualified registry name
  - has a URL scheme: direct source URL
  - resolves on disk: local path
  - otherwise: unqualified registry name
- `--name` gives an explicit local import name when needed
- without `--name`, registry-backed adds use the pack name and URL/path adds
  use the final path segment
- if the derived name collides with an unrelated existing import, `add` fails
  and asks the user to pass `--name`
- re-adding the same import name is allowed; it updates that import rather than
  forcing the user through a separate edit command
- `--version` records a version constraint in the import when the add is
  registry-backed
- `--version` is also allowed for URL and local-path adds; it is still
  recorded in the import
- if `--version` is omitted, registry-backed adds follow the registry's default
  resolution behavior
- this proposal does not freeze the resolver's default selection policy; it
  only requires that an explicit `--version` constraint, when present, be
  recorded in the import
- a qualified registry name is just a convenience handle; when `add` succeeds,
  the resulting import resolves to the underlying source or path rather than
  retaining the registry label as a separate identity

#### `gc pack remove`

```text
gc pack remove <import-name> [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- removes an import from the selected scope
- does not imply eager cache deletion
- remains strict about inbound reference blockers, meaning other local config
  still depends on that import and would be left invalid by removing it

#### `gc pack list`

```text
gc pack list [--transitive] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- with no flags, lists direct imports in scope
- with `--transitive`, lists the full resolved transitive set

Expected output:

```text
Name         Version  Source
lighthouse   ^1.2     main:lighthouse
weatherglass 0.4      ../packs/weatherglass
```

#### `gc pack show`

```text
gc pack show <import-name> [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- shows one imported pack in the selected scope
- local inspection only
- does not reach out to registry catalog views

Expected output shape:

- imported name
- source
- resolved version or release
- fetched status
- scope

Expected output:

```text
Import:         lighthouse
Source:         https://packages.example/main/lighthouse
Version:        ^1.2
Resolved:       1.2.0
Fetched:        yes
Scope:          ambient pack
```

#### `gc pack fetch`

```text
gc pack fetch [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- with no target, fetches all imports in scope
- with a target, fetches one imported pack in scope
- does not edit imports
- is the explicit warm-cache and reconcile command

#### `gc pack outdated`

```text
gc pack outdated [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- shows what `upgrade` could move
- does not mutate imports or cache
- with no target, reports all outdated imports in scope
- with a target, reports one imported pack
- respects version constraints already recorded on imports

Expected output:

```text
Name         Current  Latest allowed  Latest available  Status
lighthouse   1.1.0    1.2.0           2.0.1             upgrade available
```

#### `gc pack upgrade`

```text
gc pack upgrade [<import-name>] [--pack <path>] [--rig <name-or-path>]
```

- with no target, upgrades all imports in scope
- with a target, upgrades one imported pack
- is transitive as needed for coherent re-resolution
- fetches the new resolved result into cache
- respects version constraints already recorded on imports

### Network and offline behavior

- `gc pack outdated` should succeed against the locally available import state
  and cached metadata
- `gc pack upgrade` may fail if the needed pack content is not already cached
  and cannot be fetched
- `gc pack fetch` may fall back to cached content when the source is
  unreachable, but it should warn that network refresh failed
- registry-backed operations depend on registry reachability or cached catalog
  data; the exact caching policy for `registry.toml` itself remains a parked
  question

## `gc registry`

`gc registry` owns machine-known registry configuration and catalog browsing.

### Surface area

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gc registry list` | List configured registries from `~/.gc/registries.toml`. |
| `gc registry add <registry-name> <source>` | Add one configured registry entry. |
| `gc registry remove <registry-name>` | Remove one configured registry entry. |
| `gc registry search [query] [--registry <name>]` | Search pack entries across all registries by default; with no query, return everything. |
| `gc registry show <qualified-pack-name>` | Show one exact pack catalog entry from a registry. |

### Signatures and semantics

#### `gc registry list`

```text
gc registry list
```

- lists configured registries from `~/.gc/registries.toml`
- this is the full configured-registry view for this proposal

Expected output:

```text
Name   Source
main   https://registries.gascity.example/main/registry.toml
acme   https://registries.acme.example/catalog/registry.toml
```

#### `gc registry add`

```text
gc registry add <registry-name> <source>
```

- adds one configured registry entry
- edits `~/.gc/registries.toml`
- there are intentionally no commands here for adding or removing packs from a
  registry itself; each registry owns and manages its own published
  `registry.toml`

#### `gc registry remove`

```text
gc registry remove <registry-name>
```

- removes one configured registry entry
- edits `~/.gc/registries.toml`

#### `gc registry search`

```text
gc registry search [query] [--registry <name>]
```

- uses a plain text query, not regex
- with no query, returns all available pack entries
- searches across all configured registries by default
- `--registry <name>` narrows the search to one registry
- returns multiple results
- pagination and limiting are intentionally out of scope for this proposal

Expected output:

```text
Registry  Name         Latest  Description
main      lighthouse   1.2.0   Harbor-watch checks and incident response workflows.
acme      lighthouse   2.0.1   Acme-flavored harbor patrol and response tooling.
```

#### `gc registry show`

```text
gc registry show <qualified-pack-name>
```

- exact-address lookup for one pack catalog entry
- requires a qualified name like `main:lighthouse`
- unqualified names are intentionally not accepted here
- cross-registry "show me every registry carrying this pack" behavior is not
  part of this proposal

Expected output:

```text
Pack:         acme:lighthouse
Registry:     acme
Name:         lighthouse
Latest:       2.0.1
Description:  Acme-flavored harbor patrol and response tooling.
Source:       https://packages.example/acme/lighthouse

Releases:
- 2.0.1  abc123  Adds patrol upgrades and doctor fixes.
- 1.9.0  def456  Stabilizes maintenance workflows.
```

### Registry resolution rules

- there is no `default` registry
- first-party registry name is `main`
- `main` is simply the conventional name seeded at installation time; no CLI
  behavior depends on its continued presence
- unqualified names only resolve when exactly one registry matches in contexts
  that allow unqualified resolution
- collisions require qualified names like `acme:lighthouse`

## File Formats

These are the file-format rules.

### `registries.toml`

This is the machine-known registry config.

- lives under `~/.gc/registries.toml`
- is edited by `gc registry add` / `gc registry remove`
- does not carry pack descriptions
- does not define a default registry

Example:

```toml
schema = 1

[[registry]]
name = "main"
source = "https://registries.gascity.example/main/registry.toml"

[[registry]]
name = "acme"
source = "https://registries.acme.example/catalog/registry.toml"
```

### `registry.toml`

This is the published registry catalog file.

- each `[[pack]]` entry has a required `description`
- each `[[pack.release]]` entry has a required `description`
- `source` identifies the canonical fetch origin for the pack
- `commit` records the source revision identifier for the release; for
  git-backed sources this is naturally a git SHA, while other source kinds may
  need a more general rule in a later revision of the format
- `hash` is the integrity check for the fetched release payload or canonical
  unpacked contents

Example:

```toml
schema = 1

[[pack]]
name = "lighthouse"
description = "Harbor-watch checks and incident response workflows."
source = "https://packages.example/main/lighthouse"

  [[pack.release]]
  version = "1.2.0"
  commit = "abc123"
  hash = "sha256:..."
  description = "Adds dock patrol checks and improves incident triage."
```

### `pack.toml`

- `pack.toml` does not need a required description field for this proposal
